**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Designer)`**

My passion is to work with extremely talented people and collaborate to make products that
would make an immediate impact. I enjoy manipulating data and hack things up for any
immediate problems or projects I want to pursue. Most of my personal projects always come from a problem I want to solve, and it is by solving that problem that I grow and develop my coding abilities. I always break down the problem into smaller pieces and work my way up using and learning the necessary tools to complete it.
